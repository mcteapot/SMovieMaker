        <member name="M:Gif2Textures.GifFrames.Load(System.IO.Stream,System.Boolean)">
            <summary>
                Loads a gif stream.
            </summary>
            <param name = "stream">
                The gif stream
            </param>
            <param name = "cacheTextures">
                true to load all frames from the gif stream, convert them to textures immediately and catch them.
                This way consume more memory, but the animation can be very smooth;
                false to just load all frames from the gif stream but not convert them to textures immediately.
                Only 1 frame of gif will be converted to texture every time you call GetNextFrame. And previous frame will be released.
                So this way consume less memory, but the animation may be no so smooth becasue we have to generate a new texture and release previous one every time you call GetNextFrame.
            </param>
            <returns>
                A value that determines whether the gif loaded successfully or not. If it reture false, it means the gif stream is incomplete or it isn't a gif at all.

        <member name="M:Gif2Textures.GifFrames.GetFrameCount">
            <summary>
            Get frame count of the gif.
            </summary>
            <returns>
                The frame count of the gif.

        <member name="M:Gif2Textures.GifFrames.GetNextFrame(UnityEngine.Texture2D@,System.Single@)">
            <summary>
            Get a texture and a delay of a frame of the gif. You will get the 1st frame when 1st time call this function.
            You will get 2nd frame if you call this it again. You will get 1st frame again when you call it the N+1 (N is the frame number of the gif) time.
            So, you can just keep calling this function after the delay of previous frame to get the texture of next frame and use it no matter how.
            </summary>
            <param name = "texture">
                the texture of next frame
            </param>
            <param name = "delay">
                how long the frame should stay
            </param>
            <returns>
                A value that determines whether you get next frame successfully or not. If it return false, it means the gif hasn't been loaded successfully.

        <member name="M:Gif2Textures.GifFrames.Restart">
            <summary>
            Reset the animation. You will get the 1st frame next time you call GetNextFrame.
